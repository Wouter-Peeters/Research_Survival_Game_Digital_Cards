  "cardCount": 20,
  "cards": [
    { "id": 1, "question": "When should a data management plan (DMP) be started?", "options": { "A": "Whenever you want", "B": "At the beginning of the project", "C": "When all data is collected or produced" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "A DMP should be written at the beginning of the project to ensure you’re informed about research data management requirements and possibilities, and that good RDM practices are implemented. However, the DMP is a living document, so it should change and be updated as your research progresses."},
      { "id": 2, "question": "Why should you deposit your datasets in a repository?", "options": { "A": "To store them in a read-only environment", "B": "To collaborate directly with others on the data", "C": "To make them findable and facilitate their reuse" }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "Depositing data in a data repository makes them Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). It supports your research results and makes them verifiable. However, depending on the nature of the data, using a repository is not always an option." },
      { "id": 3, "question": "Which company had the highest profit margins in 2017?", "options": { "A": "Apple, a technology company", "B": "Elsevier, a scientific publisher", "C": "Total, an oil company" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "The profit margins of academic publishers are obscenely high (up to 40%), making some of those margins higher than even companies like Apple and Google." },
      { "id": 4, "question": "What is open peer review?", "options": { "A": "An evaluation where both authors and reviewers are known to each other", "B": "An evaluation where reviewers know the authors’ identities, but not vice versa", "C": "An evaluation where both the author and reviewer remain anonymous to each other" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Open peer review promotes transparency by revealing the identities of authors and reviewers, with reports sometimes openly published. In contrast, single-blind and double-blind peer review keep some identities anonymous. Each approach has strengths and limitations, but all aim to improve the quality of scientific knowledge." },
      { "id": 5, "question": "Which Creative Commons license should you assign for the following statement? People are free to build on my presentation and change it. They cannot charge people to hear them deliver it.", "options": { "A": "CC BY-NC-SA", "B": "CC BY-NC", "C": "CC BY" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "This license allows users to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format for non-commercial purposes only and so long as attribution is given to the creator." },
      { "id": 6, "question": "What is an ORCID iD?", "options": { "A": "A unique, persistent identifier that makes it easier to link your identity to publications", "B": "A unique, persistent identifier used to identify a digital object (e.g. a publication)", "C": "An identifier used to identify different orchid species" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "ORCID provides a persistent digital identifier (an ORCID iD) that distinguishes you from every other researcher. You can connect your iD with your professional information and use it to share your information with other systems, ensuring you receive recognition for your contributions, saving you time, and reducing the risk of errors." },
      { "id": 7, "question": "What is a paywall?", "options": { "A": "When the author must pay to publish", "B": "When the reader must pay to get access to a scholarly publication", "C": "When both the reader and the author must pay to publish or get access to a scholarly publication" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "A paywall is a digital gate that is used to monetize content. Users, either individual readers or institutions, only have access via paid subscriptions." },
      { "id": 8, "question": "What is open archiving aka Green Open Access?", "options": { "A": "The author (self-)archives a digital copy of their work in a repository and makes it available in OA", "B": "The author publishes their work in OA via the publisher", "C": "The author makes use of eco-friendly infrastructure to preserve and share their work" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "The acting party with Green OA is the author. They publish something and then take the additional step of archiving a digital version (usually the accepted version) in a repository and making this archived version freely available (often after an embargo period)." },
      { "id": 9, "question": "True or False: Cloud storage is equivalent to backups.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Cloud storage is multi-purpose. It is possible to back up your data to it, but often such a storage solution is configured to sync (mirror) data across devices. This contrasts with the rationale of a backup, which is to preserve a snapshot (exact copy) of your data at a particular time in a separate storage location." },
      { "id": 10, "question": "What is reference management software used for?", "options": { "A": "Storing, organizing, and sharing references", "B": "Organizing peer review", "C": "Creating metadata standards" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Reference management software enables you to create a personal bibliographic database. Moreover, it allows you to automatically insert references into your text while writing, create bibliographies and convert them into the desired citation style, and share references with colleagues. Examples are EndNote, Mendeley, and Zotero." },
      { "id": 11, "question": "What is a DMP?", "options": { "A": "The highest common denominator of your data sets", "B": "A digital management plan", "C": "A data management plan" }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "A DMP describes which research data you plan to generate and use in your research. It also contains information about how you organize, document, store, preserve, and share your data, in line with ethical and legal requirements. Most public funders require you to submit a DMP." },
      { "id": 12, "question": "True or False: A dataset that is publicly available in a repository can always be reused.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Before downloading data from a data repository, it is essential that you read the terms of use and/or license applicable to the dataset and observe the stipulations defined therein." },
      { "id": 13, "question": "What is a research data repository?", "options": { "A": "A shop where items are stored for donation", "B": "An infrastructure to store, search, and access digital data", "C": "An external hard drive to store files" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Data repositories allow you to publish research data in order to give them a long-term online home and share them with others. Data repositories can be general (usable by anyone) or focused on a particular field or institution." },
      { "id": 14, "question": "True or False: When citing a dataset it is sufficient to only refer to the URL.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correctly citing a dataset provides due acknowledgement to the original creator and is similar to citing other works. Most citation formats (APA, MLA, etc.) include guidance about properly citing datasets. This typically includes the author, title, date, publisher or repository, and a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI)." },
      { "id": 15, "question": "What are the preferred formats for sharing data?", "options": { "A": "Formats that I am sure to reuse in the future", "B": "Formats that my supervisors use", "C": "Open formats"}, "correct": "C", "explanation": "Using open formats improves the data’s interoperability, as other researchers now and in the future are more likely to be able to (re)use the data without needing expensive software or equipment." },
      { "id": 16, "question": "What is the DOAJ?", "options": { "A": "Database of Open Access Journals", "B": "Documentation of Open Access Journals", "C": "Directory of Open Access Journals" }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "The Directory of Open Access Journals is a community-curated database that indexes academic, peer-reviewed, fully OA journals across all disciplines and in more than 50 languages." },
      { "id": 17, "question": "What is the CC0 license?", "options": { "A": "A license that allows you to keep all rights to your work", "B": "A license that allows others to reuse your work for non-commercial purposes", "C": "A license that allows you to waive all copyright (within the limits of the law)" }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "CC0 is a public dedication tool, which allows creators to give up their copyright and place their works in the public domain. CC0 allows users to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, with no conditions" },
      { "id": 18, "question": "True or False: Funding agencies are increasingly requiring researchers to make their publications Open Access", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Most research funders mandate Open Access, requiring you to make (some of) the output arising from funded research available in Open Access." },
      { "id": 19, "question": "True or False: Green Open Access is generally free for the author.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Green Open Access, also known as self-archiving or open archiving, involves archiving a digital copy (usually the accepted version) of your publication in an online repository at no cost. This archival copy is then made available to the public, typically after an embargo period. For immediate access without an embargo, some journals may charge fees." },
      { "id": 20, "question": "True or False: It is always allowed to reuse a photograph from Google Images where no individual appears.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "If you are not the author of an illustration or photograph, you must take into account the photographer or illustrator’s copyright. Always make sure to read the terms of use and check whether the material has a reuse license stating what you are allowed to do with it. When in doubt, do not use the image." },
      { "id": 21, "question": "True or False: Publishers sometimes demand embargoes when book chapters are deposited in an open repository.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Depending on contractual clauses, book chapters might only be shared in Open Access after an embargo period, or not at all. When negotiating a contract, authors should consider whether their publication needs to be openly shared." },
      { "id": 22, "question": "True or False: Open Access articles have a greater reach than other articles.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Numerous studies show that articles available in Open Access are read and cited more than those published behind paywalls, as they tend to reach a broader audience, both inside and outside the academic community." },
      { "id": 23, "question": "True or False: Authors of an Open Access article do not have to be cited.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Open Access articles are subject to the same citation rules as articles published in traditional journals. They must be properly cited whenever referenced, just like any other scholarly work, unless the author chooses otherwise." },
      { "id": 24, "question": "True or False: Researchers are generally not compensated by journals for reviewing articles.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Publishers rarely pay for the work that goes into reviewing journal articles. This amplifies criticism regarding the for-profit business model of many publishers, as they make high profits that would otherwise be impossible without unpaid peer review." },
      { "id": 25, "question": "True or False: Full texts deposited in an open repository are easily found by search engines.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Open repositories are developed to interoperate with search engines that harvest and display links to said repositories." },
      { "id": 26, "question": "True or False: A Creative Commons license associated with a publication determines the rules of use.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Creative Commons licenses give everyone, from individual creators to large institutions, a standardized way to grant the public permission to use their creative work under copyright law. From the user’s perspective, the presence of a Creative Commons license on a copyrighted work answers the question, “What can I do with this work?”." },
      { "id": 27, "question": "What image symbolizes Open Access?", "options": { "A": "An open padlock", "B": "An eye", "C": "A globe"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "An orange open padlock symbolizes the fact that the results of academic research are accessible to anyone for free." },
      { "id": 28, "question": "What is open publishing (such as Gold, Hybrid, or Diamond OA)?", "options": { "A": "The author (self-)archives a digital copy of their work in a repository and makes it available to the public for free", "B": "The author publishes their work in immediate OA through the publisher", "C": "The author publishes in an electronic journal"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "In open publishing, the acting party is the publisher, who immediately makes the final version of a text openly available at the time of publication. Publishers do not usually do this for free, so either the author (or institution/funder) is charged with the fee, or the publication costs are covered by a group of supporters (typically a consortium of university libraries)." },
      { "id": 29, "question": "What is a hybrid journal?", "options": { "A": "A journal that publishes articles AND datasets", "B": "A journal that exists in electronic AND paper format", "C": "A journal that charges for subscription AND Open Access publication"  }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "A Hybrid Open Access journal, as opposed to a Full Open Access journal, is a subscription-based journal that provides authors with the option to publish their individual article in OA, for which they must pay a fee. The articles published in OA are freely available to readers, but the journal itself is still published behind a paywall." },
      { "id": 30, "question": "What is an embargo for a scientific publication?", "options": { "A": "The period during which a publisher or author does not allow an article to be made Open Access", "B": "The period during which an article is undergoing peer review", "C": "An article that is only available to subscribers before becoming Open Access"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Publication embargoes relate to full text availability in an institutional repository (Green Open Access). An embargo can vary in length and can be imposed by either the author (on theses, working papers, etc.) or the publisher." },
      { "id": 31, "question": "True or False: Open Access journals are freely available", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "By definition, Open Access journals are openly and freely available for everyone, provided they have an internet connection. However, while reader access is always free, this is not always the case for the authors wishing to publish in Open Access." },
      { "id": 32, "question": "True or False: Open Access journals do not have a peer review process.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Reputable Open Access journal articles go through the same peer review process as articles published in paywalled journals. They adhere to strict editorial standards and ethical guidelines, ensuring that their articles are thoroughly vetted." },
      { "id": 33, "question": "What does the CC BY license allow?", "options": { "A": "The work can only be reused by its author", "B": "The work can be shared by anyone but without making adaptations", "C": "The work can be shared and adapted, but the author must be cited"  }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "The CC BY license allows users to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, so long as attribution is given to the creator. This license also allows for commercial use." },
      { "id": 34, "question": "True or False: A researcher who publishes in Open Access waives their copyright.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Open Access is not an infringement on copyright. Authors own the original copyright to their research, but when publishing, they are often asked to transfer their property rights to the publisher. We advise all authors not to relinquish their full property rights to a publisher, encouraging authors to apply rights retention instead. Ideally, an open license (most commonly a Creative Commons license) is applied to the work so that access and reuse rights are clearly defined." },
      { "id": 35, "question": "What does “FAIR” mean?", "options": { "A": "Data that are Functional, Accurate, Inclusive, and Relevant", "B": "Data that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable", "C": "Data that are Factual, Authentic, Intuitive, and Reliable"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "The FAIR data principles are international guidelines that aim to optimize the reuse of research data and emphasize machine-actionability (i.e. to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with little to no human intervention). Key elements for FAIR data are rich metadata and documentation, using open or standard file formats, having persistent identifiers for data objects, and using licenses for reuse. Note that FAIR data doesn’t necessarily mean open data." },
      { "id": 36, "question": "What is metadata?", "options": { "A": "Information describing data", "B": "Very large data", "C": "Data collected from multiple sources"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Metadata is data about data: a structured form of documentation to help identify, find, interpret, and use data. Metadata often follow international standards that serve specific research disciplines, data types, or purposes." },
      { "id": 37, "question": "What are research data?", "options": { "A": "Only textual data", "B": "Only numerical data", "C": "All kinds of data gathered during your research"  }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "While published articles are important visible research output, most scholarly work happens within the vast amount of material underlying each publication: the research data. Note that data can be digital or analog: a (digital) data table is data just as much as physical lab samples are." },
      { "id": 38, "question": "Which of the following is definitely not personal data?", "options": { "A": "A photo of a person from behind", "B": "A 200 year old archival document", "C": "An anonymous social media post"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Personal data is any information that can lead to the identification of living people. This includes, for example, interview data and social media posts (even when posted anonymously). When personal data has been anonymized, it is legally no longer considered personal data. However, data that has been pseudonymized is still classified as personal data by law." },
      { "id": 39, "question": "Which of these is not a clause in the Creative Commons licenses?", "options": { "A": "Attribution (BY)", "B": "Use only for research (USR)", "C": "Sharing under the same conditions (SA)"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "BY stands for the fact that credit must be given to the creator and SA means that adaptations must be shared under the same terms. USR simply does not exist." },
      { "id": 40, "question": "True or False: To make my data more reusable, I can distribute my data without a license.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Licenses are not mandatory, but they are important as they inform researchers about what they can and cannot do with the published data. Without a license, your data are not Reusable and therefore not FAIR. In other words, you should always add a license to data you wish to publish to enable and set out the conditions for reuse." },
      { "id": 41, "question": "True or False: Within a project, rules for managing and sharing data must be agreed upon.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "If you are collaborating with other researchers or partners, it is very important that everyone involved fully understands how each piece of data will be handled. For example, others may use different tools, which can require you to work in a file format that you both can open. They may also be working in different institutions that work with different systems for sharing data, or have different requirements for data archival after a project." },
      { "id": 42, "question": "Why is it important to describe the data when you put it in a data repository?", "options": { "A": "To win the Grand Prize for Scientific Excellence", "B": "To remind you of what you have deposited", "C": "To facilitate the reuse of your data by other researchers"  }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "Describing your data makes them easier to read, understand, and ultimately reuse. This description includes proper documentation, such as README files and manuals on how to use the data and metadata (ideally based on metadata standards), to make the data more interoperable and reusable." },
      { "id": 43, "question": "True or False: Some journals publish both Open Access and subscriber-only articles.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "These are what we call Hybrid Open Access journals, which are subscription-based journals that provide authors the option to publish their individual article in OA by paying an author fee. The articles published in OA are freely available to the readers, but the journal itself is still published behind a paywall." },
      { "id": 44, "question": "A publication repository is:", "options": { "A": "A digital archive that is used to collect, preserve, and disseminate publications", "B": "A self-service library open 24 hours a day", "C": "A platform for listing upcoming conferences and calls for papers"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "A publication repository is a documentary database that is freely accessible on the internet. Researchers can deposit scientific or technical documents they have authored, and for which they hold the distribution rights, to make them freely accessible." },
      { "id": 45, "question": "What does DOAB mean?", "options": { "A": "Directory of Open Access Books", "B": "Database of Open Access Books", "C": "Documentation of Open Access Books"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "DOAB is a community-driven discovery service that indexes and provides access to scholarly, peer-reviewed Open Access books and helps users find trusted OA book publishers." },
      { "id": 46, "question": "True or False: You are obligated to openly share data collected with the use of public funds.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Public funders don’t usually require you to openly share all data. Funders adhere to the policy “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”, as there can be several reasons preventing you from openly sharing data, such as privacy (personal or sensitive data), ethical (human data), or licensing (reused data) issues." },
      { "id": 47, "question": "True or False: When you deposit data in several places, you are better referenced and more quoted.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "This practice is not prohibited, but is strongly discouraged. A repository allows you to obtain a unique persistent identifier, so depositing your dataset in several repositories means you will have several unique persistent identifiers to manage and several datasets to keep consistent. This also poses a problem for the legibility of the dataset citation. Aggregators harvest most repositories, which increases the findability of the dataset more than making multiple deposits would." },
      { "id": 48, "question": "True or False: It is not necessary to name your files in a concrete and understandable manner, as you are the only one who needs to understand the structure.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Documentation and well-structured file naming ensure that other researchers can understand a particular dataset and its structure, judge whether it is suitable for their research purposes, and can use it without having to contact you with questions about, for example, what each file contains. “Other researchers” might even be yourself in a few years!" },
      { "id": 49, "question": "Which of these file formats is not considered an open file format?", "options": { "A": ".csv", "B": ".pdf", "C": ".doc"  }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choosing open file formats is essential to ensure research data will remain accessible and usable in the future. Since 2008, Portable Document Format (.pdf), has been an open ISO standard for textual documents. Comma separated values (.csv) files are open plain-text files with data lines, where data points are separated by commas. Microsoft Word Binary File Format (.doc), however, is Microsoft’s proprietary document format and requires a Microsoft Word license to use without limitations." },
      { "id": 50, "question": "How should a data management plan (DMP) be drafted for a project with multiple partners and a wide range of data?", "options": { "A": "It is advised to draft a single DMP for the entire project", "B": "It is advised to draft one DMP per partner", "C": "It is advised to draft a DMP by type of data"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "For joint research projects the recommendation is to write one DMP for the entire project (coordinated by the principal investigator), using “work packages” or “subsections” to describe the different data and their planned management. Be sure to include the data of all partners and to indicate the data management responsibilities for each partner." },
      { "id": 51, "question": "True or False: Researchers are typically paid to publish in academic journals.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "In most cases, researchers are not compensated for publishing their work in academic journals. Instead, they often bear the costs associated with publishing, such as article processing charges (APCs) for Open Access journals. Additionally, researchers typically do not receive payment for reviewing manuscripts, despite the significant time and expertise required for peer review. This model raises concerns about the sustainability of the academic publishing system, where researchers contribute without financial reward while publishers profit significantly." },
      { "id": 52, "question": "As of the most recent update, approximately how many journals are listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)?", "options": { "A": "Over 10,000", "B": "Between 1,000 and 10,000", "C": "Fewer than 1,000"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "The Directory of Open Access Journals is a community-curated database that indexes academic, peer-reviewed, full OA journals across all disciplines and in more than 50 languages." },
      { "id": 53, "question": "True or False: There are no copyright restrictions for material used in scientific research and education.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "There are exceptions under copyright law which allow the use of copyrighted material in scientific research and education. However, certain conditions must be observed. For example, the use of the material cannot jeopardize the normal exploitation of the protected work." },
      { "id": 54, "question": "What is a preprint?", "options": { "A": "A summary of a research paper before submission", "B": "A version of the manuscript after peer review", "C": "A full draft research paper published openly without peer review"  }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "The advantages of preprints are that you can quickly share time-sensitive results, make your work openly and easily detectable, and create a public record of your work. However, be careful if you are considering patenting your work and keep in mind that preprints have" },
      { "id": 55, "question": "What is Creative Commons?", "options": { "A": "The most important European art collective", "B": "A non-profit organization that creates licenses and tools to enable the sharing of knowledge", "C": "group of researchers arguing for more creativity in science"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "They are most famous for providing the Creative Commons licenses, which give every person and organization in the world a free, simple, and standardized way to grant copyright permissions for creative and academic works." },
      { "id": 56, "question": "True or False: An author always has to pay to publish in Open Access with a scholarly publisher.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "While many publishers charge author fees for immediate Open Access, there are some that do not. This is referred to as Diamond Open Access, where the publishing infrastructure is subsidized by third parties (e.g. a consortium of university libraries), allowing authors to publish without any fees and readers to access the content for free." },
      { "id": 57, "question": "True or False: Anonymized data are no longer considered personal data and can be published.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "When personal data have been anonymized, it is no longer legally considered personal data. However, keep in mind that true data anonymization is difficult, and that what is often considered anonymized is actually only pseudonymized. Pseudonymized personal data is still legally considered to be personal data, as it can still be used to identify people." },
      { "id": 58, "question": "Which Creative Commons license should you assign? “I want credit for my poster. People are free to build upon and change it as long as they don’t make money from it. They must share their work under the same terms.”", "options": { "A": "CC BY-NC-SA", "B": "CC BY-NC-ND", "C": "CC BY-ND"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "This license allows users to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format for non-commercial purposes only, so long as attribution is given to the creator. If you remix, adapt, or build upon the material, you must license the modified material under identical terms." },
      { "id": 59, "question": "What is the submitted version of an article?", "options": { "A": "The version of a manuscript before peer review and editorial typesetting by the publisher", "B": "The version of a manuscript after peer review but without the final editorial typesetting by the publisher", "C": "The version of a manuscript after peer review and with typesetting and formatting by the publisher"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "The submitted version of an article, also known as preprint, pre-refereed print, or author’s original draft, is the original manuscript as it is first sent to the journal. It hasn’t yet been subject to external feedback, edits, or the publisher’s professional formatting and layout. Publishers normally allow you to share submitted versions in Open Access." },
      { "id": 60, "question": "What is the accepted version of an article?", "options": { "A": "The version of a manuscript before peer review and editorial typesetting by the publisher", "B": "The version of a manuscript after peer review but without the final editorial typesetting by the publisher", "C": "The version of a manuscript after peer review and with typesetting and formatting by the publisher"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "The accepted version, also known as the postprint, post-refereed print, or author’s accepted manuscript, reflects all revisions made during the review process and is often the last step before the article is professionally formatted for publication." },
      { "id": 61, "question": "What is a DOI?", "options": { "A": "unique, persistent identifier that makes it easier to link your identity to publications", "B": "A unique, persistent identifier used to identify a digital object (e.g. a publication)", "C": "A unique, persistent identifier that makes it easier to link your identity to datasets"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "The Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a widely used system to create trustworthy and persistent links for online content. If the URLs or services change or the resource moves, the DOI will continue to resolve to the correct resources/services at their new locations." },
      { "id": 62, "question": "True or False: A data management plan (DMP) has to be made at the start of the project but does not need any further updates.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "A DMP is a living document that should change and be updated as your research progresses. Creating a DMP early in the research process ensures that you are informed of research data management requirements and possibilities, and ensures that good RDM practices are implemented." },
      { "id": 63, "question": "True or False: Academia.edu and ResearchGate are trusted Open Access repositories.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "While these platforms can be useful for networking with colleagues and giving your work more visibility, they are not Open Access repositories as they do not offer long-term secure storage. Keep in mind that Academia.edu and ResearchGate are commercial companies whose primary aim is not to serve the academic community, but to make profit (by, for example, selling your personal data to other commercial companies)." },
      { "id": 64, "question": "True or False: Open Access facilitates plagiarism.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Open Access can actually help protect your work, as plagiarism is much easier to detect when the original work is openly available. This way, it is very clear who first came up with an idea and when plagiarism has been committed." },
      { "id": 65, "question": "True or False: Open Access publishing does not offer copyright protection.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "An open license guarantees that your work is protected. The most commonly used are Creative Commons licenses. These licenses allow you to retain copyright while specifying how others can use your work, ensuring both accessibility and control over its use." },
      { "id": 66, "question": "What is RR short for?", "options": { "A": "Rights Retention", "B": "Rights Retaining", "C": "Research Retention"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Authors applying rights retention do not transfer all their property rights to a third party. As a result, they can share the accepted version of their publication in immediate Open Access. To do this, authors add a rights retention statement when submitting a publication to a publisher. Rights retention can be necessary to fulfill funder requirements." },
      { "id": 67, "question": "Authors applying rights retention:", "options": { "A": "Sign a contract in which they transfer their property rights to a third party", "B": "Make their work copyright protected", "C": "Do not transfer all their property rights to a third party"  }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "Authors applying rights retention do not transfer all their property rights to a third party. As a result, they can share the accepted version of their publication in immediate Open Access. To do this, authors add a rights retention statement when submitting a publication to a publisher. Rights retention can be necessary to fulfill funder requirements." },
      { "id": 68, "question": "True or False: Hardware failure, software malfunction, human error, and malware or hacking are possible causes of data loss.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "It is crucial to implement a solid backup strategy where multiple copies are kept in separate locations and automated backups are regularly scheduled. Remember that this is different from syncing (or mirroring) your data to a remote storage location, as synced storage is not safe from human error." },
      { "id": 69, "question": "Which of the following is not an official term for an Open Access type?", "options": { "A": "Gold Open Access", "B": "Silver Open Access", "C": "Bronze Open Access"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Gold OA, aka open publishing, means that the publisher makes the published version of your work immediately and freely available to the public. In the Bronze OA model, the journal is officially subscription-based, but the publisher can choose to temporarily make a publication free to read on their website, without an open license. Silver OA simply does not exist." },
      { "id": 70, "question": "True or False: Manuscripts, books, maps, artefacts, and animals are all considered research data.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Research data refers to any information collected, observed, generated, or created to validate original research findings. It can take many forms, including numerical data, textual records, images, audio, video, physical samples, and software code, depending on the discipline. Research data is essential for supporting research results, enabling replication, and facilitating further discovery." },
      { "id": 71, "question": "What is the difference between primary and secondary data?", "options": { "A": "Primary = created by junior researchers; secondary = created by senior researchers", "B": "Primary = raw data; secondary = processed data", "C": "Primary = data you create yourself; secondary = data you reuse from somebody else"  }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "Primary data are data you create yourself. Secondary data are data created by somebody else. You can reuse secondary data for your own research, provided that the license allows this." },
      { "id": 72, "question": "True or False: Providing a persistent identifier, sufficient metadata, and a clear license are key elements of FAIR data.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "A persistent identifier (PID) is a unique and everlasting code that links to your data, making it permanently findable. Rich metadata provides important context for the interpretation of your data and makes it easier for machines to conduct automated analysis, which supports the findability, interoperability, and reuse of your data. A clear license indicates how the data can be used and which conditions apply." },
      { "id": 73, "question": "What is RDM?", "options": { "A": "Research Data Monitoring", "B": "Research Data Manipulation", "C": "Research Data Management"  }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "Research Data Management concerns all phases of the research cycle and includes the organization, documentation, and storage of your data. It will help you determine how to handle ethical and legal aspects related to your data, and to identify ideal data publishing and sharing strategies. It is a way to consider potential challenges accompanying the research and strategies to overcome them." },
      { "id": 74, "question": "True or False: You do not need ethical approval to work with human, animal, or dual use data.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "You need to request approval from the correct ethical committee before using data retrieved from human/animal experiments or dual use data (data with potential military applications)." },
      { "id": 75, "question": "True or False: You need to be careful when publishing data with potential for tech transfer and valorization.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Data that support or enable a potentially patentable invention or valorizable data or databases, should not be published before valorization." },
      { "id": 76, "question": "True or False: Third-party agreements are binding and can overrule other regulations.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Third-party agreements can take precedence over other regulations, including institutional regulations. This means that if you have an agreement with an external party that specifies certain terms or conditions, those terms may override the rules set by your institution. Therefore, it is essential to carefully review third-party agreements to ensure compliance with both external and institutional regulations." },
      { "id": 77, "question": "True or False: Keeping your data secure means limiting who can access your data.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Data security is the process of securing data so that only authorized people can access or modify it. Typically, you are protecting your data against physical theft, attacks over the network, and theft by employees/trusted people." },
      { "id": 78, "question": "True or False: A README file can be used to provide documentation for your research data.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Creating a README file is a simple way to provide documentation for a dataset. It makes your data understandable and usable, provides context about the data and to which research project the data belong, and how the data should be interpreted." },
      { "id": 79, "question": "True or False: Sharing data means that they are openly available.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Shared data does not necessarily mean open data. You can also choose to share your data with access controls or restrictions, such as setting an embargo until the research is published, restricting access to sensitive files, publishing only the metadata, etc. The principle of open data is to make your data “as open as possible, but as closed as necessary”." },
      { "id": 80, "question": "What is a metadata standard?", "options": { "A": "A fixed way to describe all data", "B": "A machine readable conventional structure for metadata established by the larger research community or international standard organizations", "C": "A measurement of the quality of the metadata"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Research data have their own particular and specialized structures and formats. The two meanings of “standard” are equally important: the extent to which the standard has been adopted in a certain research area, as well as the degree to which the standard is applied in a uniform way." },
      { "id": 81, "question": "True or False: Only institutional data repositories can be trusted.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "All repositories, whether institutional, domain-specific, or general, can be trusted so long as they adhere to a series of basic requirements, which include: the presence of a persistent identifier (PID) and a license or terms of use, standardized metadata, an open infrastructure, and clearly defined preservation and availability guarantees." },
      { "id": 82, "question": "True or False: Following the FAIR principles when publishing your data automatically means all your data must be made open.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "FAIR stands for Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability, principles that enhance data management and sharing. While FAIR promotes making data available as open as possible, it follows the principle of “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. This means that access to data may be restricted to protect sensitive information or comply with legal and ethical standards." },
      { "id": 83, "question": "Which is not an example of a persistent identifier?", "options": { "A": "PURL", "B": "ARK", "C": "PIN"  }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "Both PURLs (Persistent Uniform Resource Locator) and ARKs (Archival Resource Key) are persistent identifiers like DOIs (Digital Object Identifier). ARKs can be used to identify anything digital, physical, or abstract, while PURLs are URLs that provide permanent addresses for online resources. A PIN (Personal Identification Number), however, is a sequence of digits used for authentication." },
      { "id": 84, "question": "True or False: Sharing preprints on preprint servers undermines the credibility of a publication.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": ">The advantages of preprints are that you can quickly share time-sensitive results, make your work openly and easily detectable, and create a public record of your work. However, be careful if you are considering patenting your work and keep in mind that preprints have not (yet) undergone peer review." },
      { "id": 85, "question": "What does OER stand for?", "options": { "A": "Open Evaluation Records", "B": "Open Educational Resources", "C": "Open Ethical Review"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "According to UNESCO, an Open Educational Resource is “learning, teaching, and research materials in any format and medium that reside in the public domain or are under copyright that have been released under an open license, that permit no-cost access, reuse, repurpose, adaptation, and redistribution by others”." },
      { "id": 86, "question": "What is citizen science?", "options": { "A": "An AI tool that generates scientific output", "B": "An annual event where scientific discoveries are presented to the general public", "C": "A research practice where citizens participate in a scientific project"  }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "Citizen science is the practice of voluntary public participation and collaboration in scientific research, which can range from gathering data to shaping research policies." },
      { "id": 87, "question": "True or False: When you discuss your data in your publications, that counts as data sharing.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Papers/publications usually provide a description of the results derived from your research data. Sharing data means making the research data underlying your publication as openly available/accessible as possible, such as by depositing them in a data repository." },
      { "id": 88, "question": "Which device is the least suitable for storing research data?", "options": { "A": "Personal computer", "B": "External hard drive", "C": "USB stick"  }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "We strongly advise against relying on USB sticks for any storage of research data, especially confidential data, as USB sticks are very easily lost. Storing your data on your personal computer or external hard drive is possible, but can lead to data horror stories like theft, security breaches, and data loss. It is recommended to only use institutional storage solutions to maximize safety." },
      { "id": 89, "question": "What is snowballing?", "options": { "A": "Rolling a ball of snow and throwing it at your research partner", "B": "Checking the references or citations of a relevant article to find more relevant articles", "C": "Checking whether the references of a given article are correct"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Snowballing is used to identify additional literature related to a given article. This can be done via “backward snowballing”, which involves checking an article’s reference list, and/or “forward snowballing”, where the articles citing it are looked up. Snowballing can be performed manually or by using citation databases." },
      { "id": 90, "question": "True or False: SearchRxiv is a repository for search strategies.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "SearchRxiv is an Open Access platform in which researchers can report, store, and share their searches consistently, which enables them to review and reuse existing searches." },
      { "id": 91, "question": "I can use the following strategy to find articles about wine and cheese pairings:", "options": { "A": "(cheese OR brie OR stilton) OR (wine OR chianti OR merlot)", "B": "(cheese AND brie AND stilton) AND (wine AND chianti AND merlot)", "C": "(cheese OR brie OR stilton) AND (wine OR chianti OR merlot)"  }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "Terms within a key concept (e.g. cheese, brie) are associated with OR, because you want at least one of these terms to appear in your search results. Different concepts (e.g. cheese, wine) are combined with AND, because you want terms from each concept to appear in your search results." },
      { "id": 92, "question": "True or False: Google Scholar contains all relevant articles for my research.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "It is unclear what Google Scholar’s coverage is and how frequently it is updated. Google Scholar does not provide a list of the sources it indexes, so it is possible that important academic publishers may be missing. It can be used when searching for articles, but should not be the only source you use." },
      { "id": 93, "question": "Is referring to a related publication when publishing a dataset important?", "options": { "A": "Yes, because it improves the findability of the publication and dataset", "B": "Only if you haven’t already cited the dataset in the publication itself", "C": "It is never important because no one will read it"  }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Linking research output is key to increasing the visibility of said output. Just citing a dataset in a publication is typically not machine-readable, while entering a related persistent identifier (PID) on a dataset typically is. Furthermore, machine-readability is necessary for aggregators to register and process the linked information. So you should always link related research output in both directions." },
      { "id": 94, "question": "True or False: I have to publish my dataset so reviewers of my related publication can see it.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "In most repositories, you can request or generate a preview link or private URL that allows others to see the dataset while it is still in draft version. You can use this to give reviewers early access to a dataset." },
      { "id": 95, "question": "What is OpenAire?", "options": { "A": "A data repository for data publication", "B": "An aggregator of research output’s metadata", "C": "An Open Access publication platform"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "OpenAire is primarily a technical infrastructure that harvests research output from connected data providers. Only the metadata of output published elsewhere is harvested, indexed, and made available on their search portal. You cannot publish or store output in OpenAire itself." },
      { "id": 96, "question": "True or False: You can’t cite a dataset or dataset version without a DOI.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "For datasets, a citation doesn’t necessarily mean a DOI; they are often present, but not a requirement. For example, a dataset could have a different type of persistent identifier (PID), or if you cite a particular version you use the general dataset DOI and mention the version in the citation (e.g. Wouters, Hans, 2023, “Literature Review SOA References Table”, https://doi.org/10.48804/SXEQCL, KU Leuven RDR, V2)." },
      { "id": 97, "question": "What is the relation between data protection and data security?", "options": { "A": "They are synonyms for describing measures you can take to safeguard your data", "B": "Data security is one of the key elements in achieving data protection", "C": "Data protection is one of the key elements in achieving data security"  }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Data protection is defined as “legal control over access to and use of data.” Data security is key to achieving data protection. However, data protection is wide-ranging and requires a combination of administrative and technical measures, including legal aspects. Examples of data security include firewalls and encryption, while data protection also includes privacy and data backup policies." }
