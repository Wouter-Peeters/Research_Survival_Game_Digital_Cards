  "cards": [
    { "id": 1, "question": "When should a data management plan (DMP) be started?", "options": { "A": "Whenever you want", "B": "At the beginning of the project", "C": "When all data is collected or produced" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "A DMP should be written at the beginning of the project to ensure you’re informed about research data management requirements and possibilities, and that good RDM practices are implemented. However, the DMP is a living document, so it should change and be updated as your research progresses."},
      { "id": 2, "question": "Why should you deposit your datasets in a repository?", "options": { "A": "To store them in a read-only environment", "B": "To collaborate directly with others on the data", "C": "To make them findable and facilitate their reuse" }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "Depositing data in a data repository makes them Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). It supports your research results and makes them verifiable. However, depending on the nature of the data, using a repository is not always an option." },
      { "id": 3, "question": "Which company had the highest profit margins in 2017?", "options": { "A": "Apple, a technology company", "B": "Elsevier, a scientific publisher", "C": "Total, an oil company" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "The profit margins of academic publishers are obscenely high (up to 40%), making some of those margins higher than even companies like Apple and Google." },
      { "id": 4, "question": "What is open peer review?", "options": { "A": "An evaluation where both authors and reviewers are known to each other", "B": "An evaluation where reviewers know the authors’ identities, but not vice versa", "C": "An evaluation where both the author and reviewer remain anonymous to each other" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Open peer review promotes transparency by revealing the identities of authors and reviewers, with reports sometimes openly published. In contrast, single-blind and double-blind peer review keep some identities anonymous. Each approach has strengths and limitations, but all aim to improve the quality of scientific knowledge." },
      { "id": 5, "question": "Which Creative Commons license should you assign? “People are free to build on my presentation and change it. They cannot charge people to hear them deliver it."", "options": { "A": "CC BY-NC-SA", "B": "CC BY-NC", "C": "CC BY" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "This license allows users to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format for non-commercial purposes only and so long as attribution is given to the creator." },
      { "id": 6, "question": "What is an ORCID iD?", "options": { "A": "A unique, persistent identifier that makes it easier to link your identity to publications", "B": "A unique, persistent identifier used to identify a digital object (e.g. a publication)", "C": "An identifier used to identify different orchid species" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "ORCID provides a persistent digital identifier (an ORCID iD) that distinguishes you from every other researcher. You can connect your iD with your professional information and use it to share your information with other systems, ensuring you receive recognition for your contributions, saving you time, and reducing the risk of errors." },
      { "id": 7, "question": "What is a paywall?", "options": { "A": "When the author must pay to publish", "B": "When the reader must pay to get access to a scholarly publication", "C": "When both the reader and the author must pay to publish or get access to a scholarly publication" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "A paywall is a digital gate that is used to monetize content. Users, either individual readers or institutions, only have access via paid subscriptions." },
      { "id": 8, "question": "What is open archiving aka Green Open Access?", "options": { "A": "The author (self-)archives a digital copy of their work in a repository and makes it available in OA", "B": "The author publishes their work in OA via the publisher", "C": "The author makes use of eco-friendly infrastructure to preserve and share their work" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "The acting party with Green OA is the author. They publish something and then take the additional step of archiving a digital version (usually the accepted version) in a repository and making this archived version freely available (often after an embargo period)." },
      { "id": 9, "question": "True or False: Cloud storage is equivalent to backups.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Cloud storage is multi-purpose. It is possible to back up your data to it, but often such a storage solution is configured to sync (mirror) data across devices. This contrasts with the rationale of a backup, which is to preserve a snapshot (exact copy) of your data at a particular time in a separate storage location." },
      { "id": 10, "question": "What is reference management software used for?", "options": { "A": "Storing, organizing, and sharing references", "B": "Organizing peer review", "C": "Creating metadata standards" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Reference management software enables you to create a personal bibliographic database. Moreover, it allows you to automatically insert references into your text while writing, create bibliographies and convert them into the desired citation style, and share references with colleagues. Examples are EndNote, Mendeley, and Zotero." },
      { "id": 11, "question": "What is a DMP?", "options": { "A": "The highest common denominator of your data sets", "B": "A digital management plan", "C": "A data management plan" }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "A DMP describes which research data you plan to generate and use in your research. It also contains information about how you organize, document, store, preserve, and share your data, in line with ethical and legal requirements. Most public funders require you to submit a DMP." },
      { "id": 12, "question": "True or False: A dataset that is publicly available in a repository can always be reused.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Before downloading data from a data repository, it is essential that you read the terms of use and/or license applicable to the dataset and observe the stipulations defined therein." },
      { "id": 13, "question": "What is a research data repository?", "options": { "A": "A shop where items are stored for donation", "B": "An infrastructure to store, search, and access digital data", "C": "An external hard drive to store files" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Data repositories allow you to publish research data in order to give them a long-term online home and share them with others. Data repositories can be general (usable by anyone) or focused on a particular field or institution." },
      { "id": 14, "question": "True or False: When citing a dataset it is sufficient to only refer to the URL.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correctly citing a dataset provides due acknowledgement to the original creator and is similar to citing other works. Most citation formats (APA, MLA, etc.) include guidance about properly citing datasets. This typically includes the author, title, date, publisher or repository, and a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI)." },
      { "id": 15, "question": "What are the preferred formats for sharing data?", "options": { "A": "Formats that I am sure to reuse in the future", "B": "Formats that my supervisors use", "C": "Open formats"}, "correct": "C", "explanation": "Using open formats improves the data’s interoperability, as other researchers now and in the future are more likely to be able to (re)use the data without needing expensive software or equipment." },
      { "id": 16, "question": "What is the DOAJ?", "options": { "A": "Database of Open Access Journals", "B": "Documentation of Open Access Journals", "C": "Directory of Open Access Journals" }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "The Directory of Open Access Journals is a community-curated database that indexes academic, peer-reviewed, fully OA journals across all disciplines and in more than 50 languages." },
      { "id": 17, "question": "What is the CC0 license?", "options": { "A": "A license that allows you to keep all rights to your work", "B": "A license that allows others to reuse your work for non-commercial purposes", "C": "A license that allows you to waive all copyright (within the limits of the law)" }, "correct": "C", "explanation": "CC0 is a public dedication tool, which allows creators to give up their copyright and place their works in the public domain. CC0 allows users to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, with no conditions" },
      { "id": 18, "question": "True or False: Funding agencies are increasingly requiring researchers to make their publications Open Access", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "True", "explanation": "Most research funders mandate Open Access, requiring you to make (some of) the output arising from funded research available in Open Access." },
      { "id": 19, "question": "True or False: Green Open Access is generally free for the author.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "A", "explanation": "Green Open Access, also known as self-archiving or open archiving, involves archiving a digital copy (usually the accepted version) of your publication in an online repository at no cost. This archival copy is then made available to the public, typically after an embargo period. For immediate access without an embargo, some journals may charge fees." },
      { "id": 20, "question": "True or False: It is always allowed to reuse a photograph from Google Images where no individual appears.", "options": { "A": "True", "B": "False" }, "correct": "B", "explanation": "If you are not the author of an illustration or photograph, you must take into account the photographer or illustrator’s copyright. Always make sure to read the terms of use and check whether the material has a reuse license stating what you are allowed to do with it. When in doubt, do not use the image." }
