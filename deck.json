    { "id": 1, "question": "When should a data management plan (DMP) be started?", "options": { "A": "Whenever you want", "B": "At the beginning of the project", "C": "When all data is collected or produced" },
      "correct": "B", "explanation": "A DMP should be written at the beginning of the project to ensure you’re informed about research data management requirements and possibilities, and that good RDM practices are implemented.
